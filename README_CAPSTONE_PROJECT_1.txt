--------------------------- CAPSTONE PROJECT 1 - FINANCE CALCULATOR -------------

This project is based on the concept that a financial company would require me to
create a program that allows the user to access two different financial 
calculators:
An investment calculator
A home loan repayment calculator 

While it is a fairly simple project, it demonstrates my abilities with variables
and control structures, while also maintaining an easy to follow code.


---------------------------------- Installation --------------------------------


- This program can either be downloaded or copied for testing
- To download, download the file finance_calculators.py
- Open this file in any software that is capable of running python files

-ALternatively, you can copy the code from the file itself on github

----------------------------------- Usage --------------------------------------

-Once you run this file, you will see it begins to ask for user inputs
- Simply type in the values for the inputs that the program requests and
it will output your answer through the calculator. 

An example of the code output would look like : https://gyazo.com/a0145c22b220d1d60b3a730445be07ed
