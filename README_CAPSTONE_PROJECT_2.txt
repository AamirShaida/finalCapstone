--------------------------- CAPSTONE PROJECT 2 - TASK MANAGER -------------

This project requires a code that is able to:
-Regiser a user
-Add a task
-View all tasks
-View current users tasks
-Mask tasks as complete or edit tasks
-Generate reports into text files that can also be read within the program

This is a complex program that also needs visual clarity both within the code
but also within the menu output of the code, so that it has a simple user 
interface.

---------------------------------- Installation --------------------------------


- It is suggested to download this program instead of copying code

- To download, download the file task_manager.py

- Open this file in any software that is capable of running python files

----------------------------------- Usage --------------------------------------

-Once you run this file, you will see it begins to ask for user inputs

- Simply type in the values for the inputs that the program requests and
it will display a menu with multiple options. It will also generate reports in text
files, which will be produced in the same folder location as the program at the
time of running.

-The text files generated will be task_overview.txt and user_overview.txt

-An example of the code menu would look like : https://gyazo.com/163e5b01ac3faa8e33ddaed5dddb317e

-A report generated in a text file would look like: https://gyazo.com/306bb50110bf8d405059c4ce4fc80af0
